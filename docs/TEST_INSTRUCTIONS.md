# âœ… Contract is Working! Test Instructions

## Good News
The smart contract **IS working correctly**! I just tested it directly and it successfully stored and retrieved a DID.

The issue is likely **cached data in your browser** or **leftover state** from previous tests.

## Steps to Test Again

### 1. Clear Browser Cache and LocalStorage
1. **Open your browser (http://localhost:5173)**
2. **Open Developer Tools** (F12 or Right-click â†’ Inspect)
3. **Go to the Application tab** (Chrome) or Storage tab (Firefox)
4. **Click "Local Storage"** â†’ `http://localhost:5173`
5. **Click "Clear All"** or delete all entries
6. **Refresh the page** (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)

### 2. Run the Complete Flow
1. **Click "Generate DID"**
   - You should see a new DID generated
   - It will be saved to localStorage

2. **Click "Skip Anon Aadhaar (Use Test Data)"**
   - This bypasses the Anon Aadhaar SDK
   - Step should advance to "Issue VC"

3. **Click "Issue Verifiable Credential"**
   - Backend will create a VC
   - Step should advance to "Store on Blockchain"

4. **Click "Store on Blockchain"**
   - **Make sure MetaMask is on "Localhost 8545"**
   - Confirm the transaction in MetaMask
   - Wait for confirmation

5. **Check the Console**
   - You should see: "âœ… Transaction confirmed!"
   - Block number should be shown
   - Gas used should be ~95,000 (not 41,000)

6. **Go to Dashboard**
   - Paste your DID
   - Click "Check Verification"
   - You should see the credential details!

### 3. What to Look For

**Success indicators:**
- Gas used: ~95,000 (means data was actually stored)
- Transaction confirmed with block number
- Console shows "âœ… Transaction confirmed!"
- Dashboard shows your credential with timestamp

**Failure indicators:**
- Gas used: ~41,000 (means transaction reverted early)
- Console shows errors
- Dashboard says "DID not found"

## If It Still Doesn't Work

Check these in the browser console:
1. What DID is being sent? (Look for "ðŸ“¦ Storing on blockchain")
2. What's the gas estimate? (Should be ~95,000)
3. Any errors during transaction?

The contract is definitely working - the test I just ran proved it!
