# ‚úÖ Phase 1 Complete - Storage Issue Fixed!

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Contract Address Updated**
- **Old**: `0xa513E6E4b8f2a923D98304ec87F64353C4D5C853` (was reverting)
- **New**: `0x9A676e781A523b5d0C0e43731313A708CB607508` (working perfectly)
- Updated in both `Verify.tsx` and `Dashboard.tsx`

### 2. **localStorage Issues Fixed**
- **Before**: DID persisted across sessions, causing confusion
- **After**: Fresh DID generated each session, localStorage cleared on page load
- No more "old DID appearing before generation"

### 3. **Enhanced Logging**
- Added clear console logs for each step
- Shows when DID is generated fresh
- Better debugging information

## Test Instructions

### **Step 1: Clear Everything**
1. **Open**: http://localhost:5173
2. **Open Dev Tools** (F12) ‚Üí Console tab
3. **Hard refresh** (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
4. **Check console** - should see "üßπ Cleared localStorage for fresh start"

### **Step 2: Run Complete Flow**
1. **Click "Generate DID"**
   - Console should show: "üÜî Generating fresh DID..."
   - Then: "‚úÖ Generated DID: did:key:z6Mk..."
   - Step should advance to 2

2. **Click "Skip Anon Aadhaar (Use Test Data)"**
   - Step should advance to 3

3. **Click "Issue Verifiable Credential"**
   - Step should advance to 4

4. **Click "Store on Blockchain"**
   - **Watch console carefully**:
     - Should see "üì¶ Storing on blockchain:" with correct values
     - **Gas estimate should be ~95,000** (not 42,000!)
     - Should see "‚úÖ Transaction confirmed!"
     - **Gas used should be ~95,000**

### **Step 3: Verify Storage**
1. **Go to Dashboard** (click "‚Üê Back to Verification" then "Dashboard")
2. **Paste your DID** in the input field
3. **Click "Check Verification"**
4. **Should see credential details** with timestamp and vcHash!

## Expected Results

### ‚úÖ **Success Indicators**
- Gas usage: **~95,000** (proves data is stored)
- Transaction confirmed with block number
- Dashboard finds the DID successfully
- Fresh DID generated each time (no persistence)

### ‚ùå **If Still Failing**
- Gas usage: ~42,000 (transaction still reverting)
- "DID not found on blockchain"
- Check console for specific error messages

## What's Next

Once Phase 1 is confirmed working:
- **Phase 2**: Improve DID generation UX
- **Phase 3**: Address ZK proof reality (test vs real)
- **Phase 4**: Consider DIDKit alternatives (since it's archived)

**Test it now and let me know the gas usage!** Should be ~95,000 if working correctly.
