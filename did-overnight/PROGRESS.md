# Build Progress - Overnight DID Infrastructure

## ‚úÖ Completed (Hour 1-2)

### Project Setup ‚úì
- [x] Monorepo structure created (frontend, backend, contracts)
- [x] Frontend: Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- [x] Frontend dependencies: Anon Aadhaar, ethers, react-router-dom
- [x] Backend: Express + TypeScript setup
- [x] Contracts: Hardhat v2 + TypeScript

### Smart Contracts ‚úì
- [x] DIDRegistry.sol contract created
- [x] Uses AnonAadhaar contract for proof verification
- [x] Deployment script created
- [x] Contracts compile successfully ‚úì

### Frontend Pages ‚úì
- [x] App.tsx with routing and AnonAadhaarProvider
- [x] Verify.tsx page with 4-step flow
- [x] Dashboard.tsx for DID verification

### Backend API ‚úì
- [x] Express server with CORS
- [x] DID generation endpoint
- [x] VC issuance endpoint
- [x] Error handling structure

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Ready to Run!

### 1. Proof Format Mapping ‚úì
- [x] Created `proofMapper.ts` utility
- [x] Maps Anon Aadhaar proof to contract format
- [x] Validates proof data before sending
- [x] Updated `Verify.tsx` to use proof mapping

### 2. Helper Scripts ‚úì
- [x] `setup.sh` - Automated setup script
- [x] `deploy.sh` - Contract deployment helper
- [x] `start.sh` - One-command startup

### 3. Contract Integration ‚úì
- [x] DIDRegistry.sol uses AnonAadhaar contract
- [x] Deployment script ready
- [x] All contracts compile successfully

## ‚ö†Ô∏è REMAINING - Quick Setup

### 1. Install DIDKit (5 min)
```bash
cargo install didkit-cli
```

### 2. Run Setup Script
```bash
cd did-overnight
./setup.sh
```

### 3. Start Everything
```bash
./start.sh
```

### 4. Update Contract Addresses
After deployment, copy addresses from terminal output to:
- `frontend/src/pages/Verify.tsx` - CONTRACT_ADDRESS and CONTRACT_ABI
- `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` - CONTRACT_ADDRESS and CONTRACT_ABI

## üöÄ Ready to Test

1. Start Hardhat node: `cd contracts && npx hardhat node`
2. Start backend: `cd backend && npm run dev`
3. Start frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
4. Deploy contracts: `cd contracts && npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network localhost`
5. Update contract addresses in frontend files
6. Test the flow!

## üìù Notes

- All code compiles without errors
- Frontend has placeholder warnings for contract addresses (expected)
- Backend will show errors until DIDKit is installed (expected)
- Proof format mapping needed before blockchain storage will work
